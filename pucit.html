			<p1> PUCIT, Old Campus located in the heart of Lahore, neighboring the buzzing Anarkali Bazar and the Mall Road and PUCIT, New Campus located on Hanjarwal stop, PUCIT is the largest institution of higher 
			learning in Pakistan in Computer Science, Information Technology, and Software Engineering. The College took a modest start with the Center
			for Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics, Quaid-e-Azam (New) Campus, Lahore, in 1988. The first degree 
			program offered by the Center was a one-year Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science. 24 students were registered in this program 
			during the first year. The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. The Department started 2-year (4-semesters) PGD 
			leading to MSc in Computer Science under the annual system. In its first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. The number 
			doubled the following year.<br/>
			The Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen (R) Arshad Mahmood, further upgraded the Department to a constituent College in November 2000. 
			The college was named Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). The College launched the 4-year (8-semester) 
			BSc (Honors) in Compute Science program in November 2000. The classes of the new BSc (Hons) in Computer Science started in January 
			2001 with about 180 students. The program was offered on Self-Support basis only.</p1>
